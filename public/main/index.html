        <h2>🎓 What I want to do 🎓</h2>
        <p>
          In the future I want to be a game developer or a TypeScript frontend or backend developer for FAANG. I would say I am a advanced JavaScript developer and I'm learning TypeScript to get used to types. In a couple months I will start learning Rust or C++.

        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments 🏆</h2>
        <p>
          I would say my biggest accomplishments that come to mind are learning JavaScript and TypeScript, building my PC, and building a database.
